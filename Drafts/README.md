**This is for Team use only and not for marks.**

================================================
#### Onboarding
1. Initialize project on local PC
* `git clone https://github.com/ErastoRuuuuuush/CS446.git`

2. Work on this project
* `git config user.name "GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME"`
* `git config user.email "GITHUB_ACCOUNT_EMAIL@example.com"`

3. Submit to the project branch
* `git pull origin main` # Make sure you are up to date with remote
* `git checkout -b <your_branch>` # Checkout a new branch
* `git add <file>` # Add the file you made the changes
* `git commit -m <describe>` usually start with verb (e.g. complete xxx function)
* `git push -u origin HEAD` # Push to the remote machine

Rules of repo managing:
1. **Nobody** should push directly to upstream main branch
2. Any PR should only be merged with **at least 1** approve from another team member
3. Any PR should be **squashed** before merging
4. Any merged PR should have a meaningful commit message in the form `<component that is changed>:<summary of what change has been made>`
